Hi there :wave:, thanks for stopping by!

I'm Harsha. Software Engineer by profession &mdash; interested in all things Data Science, Distributed Systems and Computer Graphics. Apart from that, I enjoy travelling :bullettrain_front:, cycling :bicyclist: and reading :books:. 

For most of my career, I've worked in the Visual FX and Post production industry :popcorn:. 
Super proud to be working in the studio that made the [Gravitational renderer for the movie Interstellar][1].

This blog is an attempt to pen down thoughts, experiments, *casual stuff & things*... Feel free to DM :point_right: [@harshakc01][2] if you wish to say hi or would like to discuss about any of my posts.
