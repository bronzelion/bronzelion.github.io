      <description>The book I wish to introduce to you today is titled Accelerate ⏩, from authors Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble &amp;amp; Gene Kim. This post isn&amp;rsquo;t a review — it is a short summary of my opinions and insights gained upon reading this book. I&amp;rsquo;d highly recommend it for anyone who is writing any kind of software(I absolutely mean it 😄).
How often do we get started with writing code caring very little about deployment in the beginning — to realise that we should have thought about it from the start(even if that&amp;rsquo;s for rapid prototyping).</description>

      <description>Hi there 👋, thanks for stopping by!
I&amp;rsquo;m Harsha. Software Engineer by profession — interested in all things Data Science, Distributed Systems and Computer Graphics. Apart from that, I enjoy travelling 🚅, cycling 🚴‍♂️ and reading 📚.
