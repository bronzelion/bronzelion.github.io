      <description>The book I wish to introduce to you today is titled Accelerate ‚è©, from authors Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble &amp;amp; Gene Kim. This post isn&amp;rsquo;t a review ‚Äî it is a short summary of my opinions and insights gained upon reading this book. I&amp;rsquo;d highly recommend it for anyone who is writing any kind of software(I absolutely mean it üòÑ).
How often do we get started with writing code caring very little about deployment in the beginning ‚Äî to realise that we should have thought about it from the start(even if that&amp;rsquo;s for rapid prototyping).</description>
